# Trying out Jekyll & Github pages

On the first meet we have with what we call #codemode here in Kalmar. I wanted to try out Github pages as one of the tasks to attack.  

This is the result I came up with. A Github page made with Jekyll.

I have added some own css, custom layouts, custom permalinks and set it up locally.
